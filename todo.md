### To-Do
- [ ] make velocity PID for motor and motor group maybe make motor, make add a kf. 
- [ ] resistanceâ€“temperature relationship/model max is 70C, use quadratic, and assume copper  
- [ ] add telemetry for tracking error the difference between where it should be assuming perfect minus what odom says
- [ ] standardize the code base
- [ ] lvgl mayne later to make brain screen look not cancer
- [ ] moter dynamic stuff from these equations, V = k_s \cdot \text{sgn}(v) + k_v \cdot v + k_a \cdot a, f_c = \frac{k_s \cdot k_t}{R}, J = \frac{k_a \cdot k_t}{R}
- [ ] add unit literals
- [ ] velocity pid characterization test 
- [ ] figure out primitive pose error maybe 
- [ ] add timing metrics for the movements
- [ ] namespace the telemetry
- [ ] update characterization to use logger 
- [ ] add battery voltage compensation
